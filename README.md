# Spam Detection Model

## üìå Overview:

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using SMS data to classify messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). It employs various machine learning algorithms, including multinomial-naive-bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. Additionally, the project utilizes data preprocessing techniques such as PorterStemmer, CountVectorizer, TFIDF Vectorizer, and WordnetLemmatizer. The implementation includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Word Embeddings, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 97.84%.
